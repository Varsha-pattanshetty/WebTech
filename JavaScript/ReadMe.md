# Introduction

"From static designs to dynamic web applications, JavaScript bridges the gap."

**JavaScript** is a versatile and powerful programming language that brings life to web pages.  
My journey with JavaScript opened the doors to interactivity, DOM manipulation, and logic-driven web development.  
Itâ€™s where my passion for coding truly flourished.
