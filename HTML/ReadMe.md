# Introduction

My journey into web development began with understanding the building blocks of the web: **HTML**.  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of every webpage. It defines the structure and layout of content on the web. Learning HTML was my first step in becoming a web developer, and it gave me the confidence to explore more complex technologies.

## Key Topics Learned

### 1. Basic Structure
- Understanding `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`.
- Creating semantic layouts with tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>`.

### 2. Text Formatting
- Using tags like `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` to format content.

### 3. Links and Media
- Adding hyperlinks with `<a>` and embedding images with `<img>`.
- Embedding videos and audio with `<video>` and `<audio>`.

### 4. Forms and Inputs
- Designing forms with:
  - `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`.
  - Form attributes like `required` and `placeholder`.

### 5. Tables and Lists
- Structuring data with:
  - `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tr>`.
- Creating ordered and unordered lists with:
  - `<ol>` and `<ul>`.

HTML was my first step toward building interactive, well-structured web pages, and it laid the foundation for my web development journey.
